## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create a web application that allows users to search for books and keep track of their favorite books. The application integrates with the Google Books API to fetch book information based on user search queries.

Users can sign up or log in to their account to access additional features. When logged in, they can search for books using keywords and view the search results, which include book titles, authors, descriptions, images, and links to the books on the Google Books site. Users can save books to their account, and the saved books will be associated with their profile.

The application leverages Apollo Server and GraphQL to handle data retrieval and modification. The GraphQL API allows for efficient data fetching, reducing the number of requests needed compared to traditional RESTful APIs. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, providing scalability and flexibility for handling user data.
